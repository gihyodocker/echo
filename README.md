# echo

This repository is the simplest sample code in "Introduction to Docker/Kubernetes Practical Container Development" by [@stormcat24](https://github.com/stormcat24).

## Disclaimer

Usually, Go applications are built into executables and included in container images. However, here we use the "go run" command to simplify the process of building the container image for readers of this book.

Please understand that this is not a practical build method.
